# Electron + Angular2 boilerplate

This project is a (very) simple Electron boilerplate with Angular 2+ and hot reloading. It uses Angular CLI to generate and build the Angular application. 

## Starting a new app

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm run watch` to build the Angular application and watch for changes
3. In a second terminal launch the Electron application with `npm run electron`

## Next

- add production building and Electron packaging
